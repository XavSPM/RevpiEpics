# revpiepics

**revpiepics** is a Python library that makes it easy to create EPICS Process Variables (PVs) directly from Revolution Pi IOs, using `pythonSoftIoc` and `revpimodio2`.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Simple and fast creation of EPICS PVs from RevPi IOs  
- Automatic detection of input/output types  
- Advanced PV configuration (names, units, limits, descriptions)  
- Built-in IO update loop

---

## üîß Prerequisites

- RevPi Base Module (Connect 5/4/S/SE, Core S/SE)  
- AIO Extension Modules  
- IOs configured via the [PiCtory interface](https://revolutionpi.com/documentation/pictory/)  
- 64-bit operating system

üëâ If you‚Äôre not using a 64-bit OS, follow this guide:  
[Download and check a compatible image](https://revolutionpi.com/documentation/revpi-images/#download-and-check-image)

---

## üì• Download

After connecting to your RevPi via SSH or using the Copilote interface:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XavSPM/RevpiEpics.git
```

---

## üíæ Installation

Because Debian and its derivatives (like Raspberry Pi OS) protect the system environment from direct `pip` installations,  
you **cannot** simply run:

```bash
cd RevpiEpics
pip install .
```

### ‚úÖ Recommended: use a virtual environment

This is the cleanest and safest approach because it won‚Äôt affect system-wide packages:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd RevpiEpics
pip install .
```

Once installed, always run your scripts **with the virtual environment activated** (`source venv/bin/activate`).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Alternative (not recommended): install system-wide

If you really want to install at the system level:

```bash
cd RevpiEpics
pip install . --break-system-packages
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This can cause conflicts with packages installed via `apt`.

### Install cothread (if needed)

Depending on whether you‚Äôre using `cothread` or `asyncio` in your program, you might need to install the `cothread` library.  
For more details, see:  
[What are the differences between asyncio and using the cothread Library?](https://diamondlightsource.github.io/pythonSoftIOC/master/explanations/asyncio-cothread-differences.html)

```bash
pip install cothread
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Minimal example

```python
from softioc import builder, softioc
from revpiepics import RevPiEpics

builder.SetDeviceName("TEST")
a = RevPiEpics(debug=True, cycletime=200)  # debug and cycletime are optional

ai1 = a.builder("OutputStatus_2_i06")  # PV name = TEST:OutputStatus_2_i06
ai2 = a.builder("OutputStatus_1_i06", "Out1Status")  # PV name = TEST:Out1Status
ai3 = a.builder("InputStatus_1_i06")  # Automatic type detection
ai4 = a.builder("InputValue_1_i06")
ao1 = a.builder(io_name="OutputValue_2_i06", pv_name="Out2", DESC="Out 1", EGU="mV")  # Advanced config
ao2 = a.builder(io_name="OutputValue_1_i06", pv_name="Out1", DRVL="8000", DRVH=19000)  # Set limits

# Start the IOC
builder.LoadDatabase()
softioc.iocInit()

# Start IO loop
a.start() 

# Keep the IOC running
softioc.non_interactive_ioc()  # or softioc.interactive_ioc(globals())
```
