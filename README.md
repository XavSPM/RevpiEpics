# revpiepics

**revpiepics** is a Python library that allows you to create EPICS Process Variables (PVs) directly from Revolution Pi IOs, using `pythonSoftIoc` and `revpimodio2`.

## Prerequisites

- RevPi Base Module (Connect 5/4/S/SE, Core S/SE)
- AIO Extension Modules
- IOs configured using the PiCtory interface

To use this library, you need a 64-bit OS.  
If thatâ€™s not the case, follow this procedure:

## Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Example

```python
from softioc import builder, softioc
from revpiepics import RevPiEpics

builder.SetDeviceName("TEST")
a = RevPiEpics(debug=True, cycletime=200)  # debug and cycletime are optional

ai1 = a.builder("OutputStatus_2_i06")  # The PV name will match PiCtory
ai2 = a.builder("OutputStatus_1_i06", "Out1Status")  # The PV name will be TEST:Out1Status
ai3 = a.builder("InputStatus_1_i06")  # Automatic input type detection
ai3 = a.builder("InputValue_1_i06")
ao1 = a.builder(io_name="OutputValue_2_i06", pv_name="Out2", DESC="Out 1", EGU="mV")  # Configure like with softioc
ao2 = a.builder(io_name="OutputValue_1_i06", pv_name="Out1", DRVL="8000", DRVH=19000)  # Change limits

# Start the IOC
builder.LoadDatabase()
softioc.iocInit()
a.start()  # Start the IO loop

# Keep the IOC running in a shell
softioc.non_interactive_ioc() # or softioc.interactive_ioc(globals())
```
