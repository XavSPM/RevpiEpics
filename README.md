# revpiepics

**revpiepics** is a Python library that makes it easy to create EPICS Process Variables (PVs) directly from Revolution Pi IOs, using [`pythonSoftIoc`](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/pythonSoftIOC) and [`revpimodio2`](https://revpimodio.org/en/homepage/).


## ‚ú® Features

- Simple and fast creation of EPICS PVs from RevPi IOs  
- Automatic detection of input/output types  
- Advanced PV configuration (names, units, limits, descriptions)  
- Built-in IO update loop



## üß∞ Prerequisites

- RevPi Base Module (Connect 5/4/S/SE, Core S/SE)  
- AIO Extension Modules  
- IOs configured via the [PiCtory interface](https://revolutionpi.com/documentation/pictory/)  
- 64-bit operating system
    
üëâ If you‚Äôre not using a 64-bit OS, follow this guide:

## üì• Download

On your RevPi via SSH or using the Copilot interface :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XavSPM/RevpiEpics.git
```

---

## üì• Installation

As Debian and its derivatives (such as Raspberry Pi OS) protect the system environment against direct `pip` installations, there are two ways of installing RevPiEpics:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use a virtual environment

This is the cleanest and safest approach because it won‚Äôt affect system-wide packages:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd RevpiEpics
pip install .
```

Once installed, always run your scripts **with the virtual environment activated** (`source venv/bin/activate`).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install system-wide

To install at system level:

```bash
cd RevpiEpics
pip install . --break-system-packages
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This may cause conflicts with packages installed via `apt`.

However, this technique allows you to use `RevPiEpics` with [`RevPi Commander`](https://revolutionpi.com/documentation/tutorials/python/).

### Install cothread (if needed)

Depending on whether you‚Äôre using `cothread` or `asyncio` in your program, you might need to install the `cothread` library.  
For more details, see:  
[What are the differences between asyncio and using the cothread Library?](https://diamondlightsource.github.io/pythonSoftIOC/master/explanations/asyncio-cothread-differences.html)

```bash
pip install cothread
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Minimal example

```python
from revpiepics import RevPiEpics
from softioc import builder
builder.SetDeviceName("TEST")

# Initialisation 
RevPiEpics.init(debug=True, cycletime=200) # debug and cycletime are optional

ai1 = RevPiEpics.builder("OutputStatus_2_i06") # PV name = TEST:OutputStatus_2_i06
ai2 = RevPiEpics.builder("OutputStatus_1_i06", "Out1Status") # PV name = TEST:Out1Status

# Automatic type detection
ai3 = RevPiEpics.builder("InputStatus_1_i06")
ai4 = RevPiEpics.builder("InputValue_1_i06")

# Advanced configuration of the softioc option
ao1 = RevPiEpics.builder(io_name="OutputValue_2_i06", pv_name="Out2", DESC="Out 1", EGU="mV")  # Advanced config

# Set limits (only for output)
ao2 = RevPiEpics.builder(io_name="OutputValue_1_i06", pv_name="Out1", DRVL="8000", DRVH=19000)

# Start IO loop and IOC
RevPiEpics.start() 
```

### Example of the use of cyclic programming with cothread

This example shows how to implement a cyclic processing loop with ‚Äúcothread‚Äù.

```python
from softioc import builder
from revpiepics import RevPiEpics
import cothread

builder.SetDeviceName("TEST")
RevPiEpics.init()


ai1 = RevPiEpics.builder(io_name="OutputValue_1_i06", pv_name="Out1")
ai2 = RevPiEpics.builder(io_name="InputValue_1_i06", pv_name="Int1")

def update():
    while True:
        ai1.set(ai2.get() + 100)
        cothread.Sleep(1)

cothread.Spawn(update)

RevPiEpics.start()
```

### Example of the use of cyclic programming with asyncio

This example shows how to implement a cyclic processing loop with ‚Äúasyncio‚Äù.

```python
from softioc import builder, asyncio_dispatcher
from revpiepics import RevPiEpics
import asyncio

# Create an asyncio dispatcher, the event loop is now running
dispatcher = asyncio_dispatcher.AsyncioDispatcher()

builder.SetDeviceName("TEST")
RevPiEpics.init()

ai1 = RevPiEpics.builder(io_name="OutputValue_1_i06", pv_name="Out1")
ai2 = RevPiEpics.builder(io_name="InputValue_1_i06", pv_name="Int1")

async def update():
    while True:
        ai1.set(ai2.get() + 100)
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

dispatcher(update)

RevPiEpics.start(dispatcher=dispatcher)
```
